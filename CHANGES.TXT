- put a protection on the options that requires a pentium
- now brmsx estimate the clock speed of the processor in startup

release 1.36:

- added a tweaked-vga mode to do 256x200 resolution;
  with this, the msx screen uses almost all the monitor area,
  and as a bonus we get another 19% in speed gain,
  in all the screens!!

  available now are 320x200 and 256x200

  now the emulation should be faster

release 1.31:

- added pseudo-support for megarom mode-5 (ascii 16kb) 
- added new debug key "K" to switch between megarom modes
- now an error in emulation will generate an interrupt
  this will make emulation about 5% faster since
  the error checking is done outside the main loop  
- optimized CP opcode

release 1.30: [*] public version

- added IN reg,(C)

release 1.29:

- added three levels of synchronization:
  NORMAL MODE: synchronizes on every interrupt
  FAST MODE: does not synchronize, but ints are still generated at 60 Hz
  TURBO MODE: ints are generated at more than 60 Hz
  "M" key switches between the modes
- removed useless debug commands: X, P, K
- added EX (SP),IX -> now Animal Basket is playable

release 1.28:

- new unificated "emulate" pipeline
- msxvram is now allocated in real time, it reduces the executable size
  and will make life easier when I'll implement msx2 emulation
- fixed timing of automatic opcodes  
- RETI does not enable interrupts now, because of this megarom games 
  doesn't lock anymore

release 1.27:

- changed the memory model to 8k banks instead of 16k banks
- now the bank switch is also done on the "slot" variable,
  this way you can change the banks to another slot and then
  back, preserving the megarom bank selectors. With this change
  F1 Spirit now run.
- changed interrupt emulation, now MSX timing has higher priority
  than PC timing. This will slow down emulation on slower machines,
  but it can prevent deadlocks. As a side effect, Nemesis run on 
  correct speed.
- added LD SP,IY instruction

release 1.26:

- fixed timings of instructions in Z80??.ASM
- added synchronization at interrupt-level
