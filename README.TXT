1. What is BRMSX ?

       

2. Requirements

        A 32-bit 80x86 processor is required.
        BRMSX runs at full framerate in a 486sx25.

        You will need about 2Mb of RAM memory. 
        Probably you'll need 4Mb for emulation of .DSK images.

        A Pentium processor is required to enable the performance bars.
        A MMX processor is not required, 
        but BRMSX may use the special MMX opcodes to run faster.

        A VGA board with 256kb of video memory is required.
        SVGA with a VESA 2.0 driver is required to enable the TV emulation.
        The special 256x200 may not work in older monitors.

        Sound emulation requires a Sound Blaster compatible card,
        capable of auto-init DMA at 45455 Hz.

        Multiplayer game requires in both sides an 
        UART capable of 57600 bauds.
        The client computer can be as slow as a 386.

3. Features

        BRMSX emulates a brazilian MSX clone called "Expert 1.0".
        This computer is an standard MSX-1 with following hardware:

        CPU: Zilog Z80 at 3.57 MHz
        VDP: Texas TMS9918 at 60 Hz
        PSG: G.I. AY-3-8910
        PPI: Intel 8255

        BRMSX also has support for the following external cartridges:

        - 16kb located at 4000h or 8000h (both ASM and BASIC cartridges)
        - 32kb located at 4000h
        - 128kb/256kb Konami-style MegaROM cartridge
        - 256kb MegaRAM memory expansion cartridge

        Most of people doesn't know the MegaRAM: it's a special cartridge
very common in Brazil. Works just like a Konami MegaROM, but with RAM 
instead of ROM. The MegaRAM is not compatible with the standard Memory 
Mapper used in MSX2, but it has many nice features not found on the Mapper.

        The Z80 emulated is near perfect. To check Z80 compliance, you can 
use the ZEX ("Z80 exerciser"), a nice program that tests most of the Z80 
opcodes. So far, BRMSX is the only MSX emulator to pass in all tests. 
        BRMSX emulate all instructions, documented and undocumented, and
all flags, documented and undocumented. All three interrupt modes are 
supported.

        VDP emulation is not complete. The following VDP features 
are emulated:
        - VDP control bits M1,M2,M3,IE,CLEAR
        - support to all MSX-1 screens (0,1,2 and 3)
        - support to 16x16, non-magnified sprites
        - support to EC and 0D0h sprite controls

        Sound is also limited in this version. The only type of sound
emitted is the square-wave sound generated by the PSG. The noise channel
is not emulated, and some games will lose its drums and special sound 
effects.
